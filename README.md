🏰 "Castles War" - A Strategy Game Project 🏹

I had the opportunity to embark on a captivating journey in the world of game design with the Computer Programming exam project "Castles War." 🎮

🔸 Overview:
"Castles War" is a 2D side-view strategy game crafted using different pygame library. 🚀 This project challenged me tostart diving deep into the realm of game development and programming.

🔹 Gameplay:
In this action-packed game, two players engage in a fierce battle, each taking control of their castle 🏯, complete with a protective wall, vital buildings, and formidable units. The ultimate goal? Demolish your opponent's wall and claim victory! 💥

🔸 Key Elements:
Each castle boasts a trio of essential buildings:

🏰 Tower: A strategic defense structure capable of fending off attackers.
⚔️ Barracks: A training ground for producing powerful military units.
⛏️ Mine: A resource-rich area where workers can gather valuable resources.

🔹 Units:
"Castles War" introduces three distinct types of units:

🛠️ Worker: A crucial civil unit that can be dispatched to mines for resource extraction or sent to the wall for repairs.
⚔️ Swordsman: A formidable military unit equipped with a short-range attack, capable of taking on enemy units and walls.
🏹 Archer: A skilled military unit with a long-range attack, making them adept at targeting adversary units and walls.

🔸 Intricate Design:
Every unit in the game boasts a unique set of parameters that govern their behavior and abilities, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay. 💡

In "Castles War," I embraced the challenge of creating an engaging multiplayer experience, where two players could compete head-to-head using the same keyboard and display. 
This project has been a remarkable journey in game design and development, where I combined creativity, strategy, and problem-solving. 🚁🏹
